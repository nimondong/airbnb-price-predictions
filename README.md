# üè† Predicting Airbnb Listing Prices with Machine and Deep Learning üè†

Airbnb is a popular online marketplace company focused on offering lodging, accommodations, and tourism experiences for travelers around the world. In this final project, I aimed predict Airbnb listing prices in the city of Chicago using a variety of machine learning methodologies including random forest regression, XGBoost, as well as a neural network. 

Overall, random forest regression was the best performing model with a average test error of 0.2393. With this in mind, I showed that a more complex deep learning model is not necessary in the case of this regression prediction problem. 

Through random forest regression and XGBost it was determined that the top five most important features were the following: 

1. The number of people the property accommodates 
2. Room type (e.g. whole house or private room)
3. Cleaning fees
4. Walk score
5. The price per additional guest above the guests

Overall, for practical applications, these models can give a host an optimal price they should charge for their new listing. On the consumer side, this will help travelers determine whether or not the listing price they see is "worth it".
